# re:form.ed

Converting JSON into an HTML Form and back

## Reasoning

JSON is a super handy document format that's being used more and more
frequently in Web API's and [databases](http://couchdb.apache.org/) However,
there's not really a handy little form editor for quickly generating or
modifying JSON docs...until now (we hope)!

## Simple JSON Editing

re:form.ed's goal is to quickly take any JSON document, turn it into an HTML
form, let you change values and keys, and modify the entire structure of the
JSON document (add new objects, etc), and then output the form back into JSON.

Version 0.1 does the basic JSON to HTML Form conversion, allows you to change
keys and values, and output it as a JSON document again.
